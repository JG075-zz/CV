I’m a full-stack web developer with a passion for crafting impactful products and services. I've been involved in IT from a young age, started a profitable company, and recently graduated from a 16-week boot camp in web development.

I'm currently looking for a junior web development role, in an environment where I can be both challenged and grow as a developer.

## Skills

### Persistent Problem Solver

One of the big reasons I love to code is the challenge of solving a problem or debugging an issue. Some scenarios where I have used my problems solving skills:

* **Building a Virtual Reality car** – There were many challenges I had to overcome to implement a drivable car in our game, such as: learning a new language (C#), utilize motion controls, and understanding in-game physics.
* **Helping my cohort** – Solved a tedious problem preventing the use of Capybara (test framework), and shared my solution that helped the rest of my cohort to move forward.
* **Improving conversion rates** – Figuring out why conversion rates were low on a website, then improving conversions by using analytics data and A/B split testing.
* **Debugging computers** – Fixed numerous slow running computers and diagnosed faulty components using a methodical approach.

### Efficient Self Learner

Shortly after owning my first PC at a young age, I started learning about graphic design, animation, and website building. Since then I have taught myself:

* **HTML5 & CSS3** – Using these skills to develop both client and self-built sites.
* **Using AWS to setup a LAMP server** – Having no prior knowledge of Linux or AWS.
* **Node.js** – Completed an in-depth online course consisting of 98 lectures.
* **Makers Academy** – A very self-taught driven course: learning core web programming languages, testing frameworks, and best coding practices.
* **SEO** – Learnt how to effectively optimize and boost Search Engine rankings for websites.
* **Conversion Optimization** – Learnt how to improve site conversions using better copy, A/B split testing, site analytics, and best practices for structuring a website.

### Passionate Team Worker

I try to make a positive impact when working in a team by: clearly communicating ideas, keeping up morale, and improving our workflow. Scenarios involving team work:

* **Makers Academy** – This course involved several team projects working on building an MVP. In particular, I was known to diagram our approaches so everyone was informed and could debate different ideas. Also ensuring we followed best practices such as TDD and using agile principles.
* **Repair technician** – Using my knowledge of website development and IT I worked outside of my role to provide additional value refining the company’s website.
* **College projects** – Teaching other students how to use Photoshop to design web interfaces and modify images.
